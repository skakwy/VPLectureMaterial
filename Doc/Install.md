# Development Tools
The examples, excersises and exam are based on a specific set of tools. The tools include basically an ARM compiler toolchain, an IDE and tools to support on-target debugging on a STM32 Nucleo board. 

The installation script respectively the explanation of the manual installation is based on a Linux machine. All the necessary tools are also available of other platforms (Windows, MacOS) but the installation and configuration for those platforms must be done by your own. The following tools are needed at a minimim:
- GNU GCC Toolchain for Target-System (i.e x86_64)
- GNU GCC Toolchain for ARM System
- OpenOCD for GDB/JTAG Debugging
- Make build system (e.g. for Windows mingw32-make)
- Eclipse C/C++ IDE Package


# Installation based on Kali VM
Download and install VirtualBox on your system

If you don't want to install a Linux distribution by your own, just download a ready-to-use Kali Linux VM
https://www.kali.org/get-kali/#kali-virtual-machines

# Installation on MacOs
For this follow the guide in [macos.md](macos.md).

## Get Install Script (install everything via script)
The following commands will download the installation script from the GitHub repo and run it.

    $ sudo apt-get install curl
    $ cd ~
    $ curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/asschmidt/VPLectureMaterial/refs/heads/main/Setup/install.sh >> install.sh
    $ bash install.sh

After the script has finished, you have to reload your bash profile to get the new path environment activated

    $ source .profile

## Manual installation
The following tools should be installed on the Linux system used for the Lecture examples

- NeoVim
- XZ Utils
- Git
- GCC and build essentials (incl. Make)
- OpenJDK
- CMake
- Python
- Curl
- WGet
- ImHex
- Ghidra

To install the tools, run the following commands

    $ sudo apt-get update

    $ sudo apt-get install neovim xz-utils git gcc build-essential
    $ sudo apt-get install openjdk-21-jdk cmake python3 curl wget imhex ghidra


### ARM GNU Toolchain

    $ cd ~
    $ mkdir Tools
	$ cd Tools

    $ wget https://armkeil.blob.core.windows.net/developer/Files/downloads/gnu/14.3.rel1/binrel/arm-gnu-toolchain-14.3.rel1-x86_64-arm-none-eabi.tar.xz

    $ tar xvfJ arm-gnu-toolchain-14.3.rel1-x86_64-arm-none-eabi.tar.xz

    $ mv arm-gnu-toolchain-14.3.rel1-x86_64-arm-none-eabi arm-gnu-toolchain

To run the GNU ARM tools from any directory, the `PATH` environment variable must be extended. For this, open the file `.profile` in NeoVim (or any other editor) and add the following line

    export PATH=$PATH:~/Tools/arm-gnu-toolchain/bin

After saving the file, it must be reloaded to apply the changes and make them available

    $ source .profile

### QEmu

    $ sudo apt-get install qemu-system

### OpenOCD

    $ sudo apt-get install openocd

### Eclipse

Download Eclipse for C/C++

    $ cd ~/Tools

    $ wget https://ftp.halifax.rwth-aachen.de/eclipse/technology/epp/downloads/release/2025-09/R/eclipse-cpp-2025-09-R-linux-gtk-x86_64.tar.gz

    $ tar xvfz eclipse-cpp-2025-09-R-linux-gtk-x86_64.tar.gz

Update the `.profile` file regarding the PATH variable

    export PATH=$PATH:~/Tools/eclipse
